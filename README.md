2. Install the required Python packages.

To install the packages, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following:

bash
pip install pillow opencv-python-headless numpy


This will install:
- *Pillow*: For handling and editing images.
- *OpenCV*: For computer vision tasks (edge detection and cartoon effect).
- *NumPy*: For image array manipulation.

## How to Run the Application
